Repacked Iconic fonts. Mostly, for use in fontello. If you plan to use it
in your project - see license details on [original page](http://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic/).

Note, that ALL requests about artwork should be sent into original project.


Info
----

Difference from original:

- single file
- mapped to fit unicode 6.1 standard (where possible)
- hinted with `ttfautohint`
- better demo page + css
- hidden some symbols, unclear at small sizes (see tail of config file)
- changed css glyphs names, to be more semantic
